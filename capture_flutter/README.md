# _Capture_ SDK Flutter plugin
A Flutter plugin for Microblink's Capture SDK, an SDK used for auto-capturing high quality images of identity documents in a user-friendly way.

For maximum performance and full access to all features, itâ€™s best to go with one of our native SDKs (for [iOS](https://github.com/BlinkID/capture-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/BlinkID/capture-android)).

## Requirements
The Capture Flutter plugin is built with Flutter v3.24.2.
All of the versions and depencies of the capture_flutter plugin can be viewed in the [pubsec.yaml](https://github.com/BlinkID/capture-flutter/blob/main/capture_flutter/pubspec.yamll) file.

The plugin has requirements on the native iOS & Android end, which can be viewed here:

|   Requirement  	|         iOS        	|          Android         	|
|:--------------:	|:------------------:	|:------------------------:	|
| OS/API version 	| iOS 13.0 and newer 	| API version 21 and newer 	|
| Camera quality 	| At least 1080p     	| At least 1080p           	|

For more detailed information about the device requirements, go to the native documention here for [iOS](https://github.com/BlinkID/capture-ios?tab=readme-ov-file#-requirements) and [Android](https://github.com/BlinkID/capture-android?tab=readme-ov-file#-device-requirements).

## Quickstart with the sample application
The sample application demonstrates how the Capture SDK is implemented, used and how to obtain the captured results.

To run it follow the steps:
1. Git clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlinkID/capture-flutter.git
```
2. Position to the obtained Capture folder and run the `initCaptureFlutterSample.sh` script:
```bash
cd capture_flutter && ./initCaptureFlutterSample.sh
```
3. After the script finishes running, position to the `sample` folder and run the `flutter run` command:
```bash
cd sample && flutter run
```
4. Pick the platform to run the Capture SDK on.

Note: the plugin can be run directly via Xcode and Android Studio:
1. Open the `Runner.xcworkspace` in the path: `sample/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` to run the iOS sample application.
2. Open the `android` folder via Android Studio in the `sample` folder to run the Android sample application.

## Integration
To add the Capture plugin to your Flutter application, simply add the following dependency in the pubsec.yaml:
```
dependencies:
...
  capture_flutter:
```

## Plugin usage
1. After the dependency has been added to the project, firstly add the neccessery imports:
```dart
import 'package:capture_flutter/capture_flutter.dart';
import 'package:capture_flutter/capture_settings.dart';
import 'package:capture_flutter/capture_enums.dart';
import 'package:capture_flutter/capture_analyzer_result.dart';
```
2. Initialize the Capture plugin:
```dart
final capturePlugin = CaptureFlutter();
```
3. Set all of the neccessary Capture settings (Analyzer, UX and Camera). You do not need to modify anything from these settings:
```dart
// Create Capture settings

// Modify Capture UX settings
settings.uxSettings?.showOnboardingInfo = true;
settings.uxSettings?.showIntroductionDialog = true;
settings.uxSettings?.showHelpTooltipTimeIntervalMs = 2000;

// Modify Capture Analyzer settings
settings.analyzerSettings?.captureStrategy = CaptureStrategy.Default;
settings.analyzerSettings?.documentFramingMargin = 0.01;
settings.analyzerSettings?.keepMarginOnTransformedDocumentImage = true;

// Modify Capture Camera settings
settings.cameraSettings?.iosCameraResolution = IosCameraResolution.Resolution4K;
```

4. Add the license key and previously configured Capture settings, and obtain the results after the capture process has finished:
```dart
// Add the license key
var licenseKey = "";
if (Theme.of(context).platform == TargetPlatform.iOS) {
    licenseKey = "your-iOS-license-key";
} else if (Theme.of(context).platform == TargetPlatform.android) {
    licenseKey = 'your-Android-license-key';
} else {
    licenseKey = "";
}

// Add the license key and the Capture settings in the scanWithCamera method
var results = await capturePlugin.scanWithCamera(settings,licenseKey);

if (results?.completnessStatus == CompletnessStatus.Complete) {
  // handle the obtained results
  print(result?.documentGroup);
}
```

The whole integration process can be found in the sample apps `main.dart` file [here](https://github.com/BlinkID/capture-flutter/blob/main/sample_files/main.dart).
